      <h2>WHO ARE RIOT GAMES, THE DEVELOPERS OF VALORANT?</h2>
      <p>If you play Valorant, you've probably heard of its developer and publisher: Riot Games. A mastodon of the online video game and esport scene, the company has been making millions of players around the world dream for almost fifteen years now. But who is it really? We take you on a tour of the company's achievements through this non-exhaustive presentation.</p>
      <h3>THE ORIGINS OF RIOT GAMES</h3>
      <p>Founded in 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merill, the company launched its first game in 2009. It is League of Legends, a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). In this 5v5 game, each player plays a different character and must defend his base while trying to destroy his opponents' base. Very quickly, the MOBA genre became popular, until it became viral. Thousands of people play it and become passionate about this game which will become one of the pillars of esports in the world.</p>
      <p>For almost 10 years, League of Legends was the sole creation of Riot Games. The publisher will do everything in its power to make its game evolve and grow. Patches are regularly deployed to bring new content, fix bugs, balance champions, introduce new skins and sometimes new champions.</p>
      <p>As MOBA is a competitive genre by nature, League of Legends tournaments are starting to spring up all over the world. Little by little, different leagues are set up in different regions of the world, each with its own national league, and the best teams meet every year for the ultimate event: the Worlds.</p>
      <h3>THUS WAS BORN VALORANT</h3>
      <p>VALORANT was officially released on 2nd June 2020 although thousands of players had early access to the game through a beta. After League of Legends, it is now Riot Games' second most popular and most watched game.</p>
      <p>In almost two years, the FPS has evolved considerably. The developers are working hard to continually bring new content and agents to players, while doing their best to fix any bugs that may be found.</p>
      <p>It is also a very dynamic and competitive game, played all over the world and with its own leagues and worlds, just like League of Legends.</p>
